# CPU-Scheduling-Algo

This repository contains the basic CPU Scheduling Algorithms from which an Operating System decides the scheduling of process to be executed. 
All the algorithms inside are preemptive in nature, i.e. context switching is possible. The algorithms include:
1)First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2)Shortest Job First (SJF)
3)Round Robin (RR)
4)Priority Scheduling Algorithm.
